This dataset seems structured for a machine learning project involving tasks like data processing, model training, and predictions. 
The mix of Markdown and Code indicates that the dataset explains concepts step-by-step while executing the necessary ML code.
The dataset performs operations such as importing libraries, loading and preprocessing data, training models using Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Random Forest Regression, evaluating their performance, and visualizing results to make predictions.
Here we take the ML model that have the most accuracy compared to others.
